# etch-a-sketch

The purpose of this project is to put to the test skills related to DOM manipulation and user interactivity using Javascript.

The application consists of a square grid of tiles which, upon being hovered by the pointer, will adopt a random color. The user can reset the grid to a blank slate or change the size of the grid and start over.

The specifications for this task can be found at the [Foundations webpage.](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)
